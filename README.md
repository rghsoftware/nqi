## üß† Core Features

### **Quest-Based Agile Workflow**

Transform the traditional Agile methodology into a personal productivity system
that acknowledges the unique challenges of ADHD minds. Break overwhelming
projects into concrete, time-boxed quests that provide clear direction and
achievable progress.

### **Knowledge Management System**

Preserve learning and insights across interest cycles through structured
knowledge capture. Create searchable fragments of techniques, resources,
warnings, and context that persist beyond individual projects.

### **Inventory Tracking**

Visual, photo-based system for tracking project supplies and materials. Barcode
scanning, location tracking, and AI-powered duplicate detection prevent wasteful
repeat purchases.

### **Body Doubling Integration**

Three modes of virtual co-working support from silent presence to full video
sessions. Peer-to-peer connections maintain privacy while providing the
accountability benefits of working alongside others.

### **Accessibility & Customization**

Comprehensive accessibility features including reduced animations, high contrast
modes, large text options, and keyboard navigation. Fully customizable interface
accommodates different sensory needs and preferences.
